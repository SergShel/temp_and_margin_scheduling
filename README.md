# Temperature and Margin Scheduling for Multimodal Contrastive Learning on Long-Tail Data

This repository hosts the complete PDF of my master's thesis, which details an in-depth exploration of multimodal contrastive learning.

In this research, we tackled key challenges of multimodal contrastive learning such as long-tail data distribution and the modality gap.
For evaluation, the focus was primarily on video retrieval and multi-instance retrieval tasks, demonstrating the practical applications and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
